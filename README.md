# sdc-fwrule

This repository is part of the Joyent SmartDataCenter project (SDC).  For
contribution guidelines, issues, and general documentation, visit the main
[SDC](http://github.com/joyent/sdc) project page.

This contains shared code for manipulating SmartDataCenter firewall rules.
There are two parts to this package:

* A Jison grammar (src/fwrule.jison) that specifies a DSL for writing
  firewall rules. This is used to generate the parser (lib/parser.js)
* A rule object that wraps the parser and provides various convenience
  and serialization methods.

The parser is currently checked in to avoid requiring jison to be installed
in order to use this package.

# Development

If you update the jison grammar, run the following to regenerate the parser:

    make parser

Before checking in, please run:

    make check

and fix any warnings. Note that jsstyle will stop after the first file with an
error, so you may need to run this multiple times while fixing.

For non-trivial changes, please add a unit test that covers the functionality
of the change. If this is a syntax change, update docs/rules.md.in and
docs/examples.md.in accordingly.


# Testing

To run all tests:

    make test

To run an individual test:

    ./node_modules/.bin/nodeunit <path to test file>
